<b>Assignment #4</b>
<br><br>
<b>Project Name:</b> Box Explained: Memes
<br><br>
<b>Project Description:</b> The project is a mockumentary designed to mimic those created by Vox. It strives to educate the viewer about the origins of and the processes behind Memes while being light-hearted enough to not lose the essence of the subject matter.
<br><br>
<b>Process:</b> The video is split into 3 separate interviews bookended by an introduction and a summary. Taking inspiration from the website, "7 Deadly Sins", a video introducing the topic of the mockumentary starts playing on loading the website. This video follows the interviewer as she lays down the groundwork of what the rest of the videos will discuss - memes. The user is then taken to the part of the website containing the rest of the videos, and is given the freedom to explore on his/her own. We tried to have the setting of each interview as to reflect the personality of the interviewee. The entire mockumentary was shot on iPhone 11 and Samsung A70. Audacity and Adobe Premiere were used in post-production for sound and video editing.
<br><br>
<b>Reflection/Evaluation:</b> After extensive efforts, from tweaking the script in the pre-production stage, to finding the perfect camera angles and redoing the same shots again and again for the final product to be satisfactory enough, to painstakingly stitching together all the different shots and editing it to flow smoothly in the post-production stage, we can say that we are pretty happy with the final version. The mockumentary looks and <i>feels</i> like a professional documentary and is housed quite well on the website.
